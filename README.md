[Systems Level Programming and Nerd Culture 1](http://www.stuycs.org/courses/mks65/dw) Final Project Design Document

Abstract
--------

A [Multi-User Dungeon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) game that allows users to connect to a central server and manipulate a virtual character and environment. Planned features, in order of importance, include:

- [x] An effective client/server model built on sockets.
- [ ] An interface for users to send commands to the server and receive feedback.
- [ ] Cuztomized datatypes to store user and world information.
- [ ] Combat!!!!!!! (Because who *doesn't* want combat?)

(And if not all of this works out, at the worst it'll just be a glorified chat client with some RPG-like features, which is still kinda cool if you think about it.)
